//chapter 2 Exercise from the slide

1) 

● To state that a program calculates the product of three integers and declare the variables:

// This program calculates the product of three integers. 
#include <iostream>
 using namespace std;
 int main()
 { int x, y, z, result; // rest of the code goes here
 return 0; 
}

● To prompt the user to enter three integers:
cpp
Copy code
cout << "Please enter three integers: ";

 ● To read three integers from the keyboard and store them in the variables x, y, and z:

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
 x = scanner.nextInt(); 
y = scanner.nextInt(); 
z = scanner.nextInt(); 

●  To compute the product of the three integers contained in variables x, y, and z, and assign the result to the variable result:

result = x * y * z;

● To print "The product is " followed by the value of the variable result:


System.out.println("The product is " + result);

● To return a value from main indicating that the program terminated successfully:


return 0;


●  Putting it all together:


// This program calculates the product of three integers.
 import java.util.Scanner; 
public class Main { 
public static void main(String[] args) {
 int x, y, z, result; System.out.println("Please enter three integers: ");
 Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); 
x = scanner.nextInt(); 
y = scanner.nextInt(); 
z = scanner.nextInt(); 
result = x * y * z; 
System.out.println("The product is " + result); 
}
 }
